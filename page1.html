  <h2>Additional Education and Certifications</h2>
  <p class="small-text">In addition to my formal education, I have actively pursued online courses to broaden my skills and knowledge. One of the notable courses I completed is the Python for Everybody program by the University of Michigan on Coursera. This course provided me with a strong foundation in Python programming, covering essential concepts such as data structures, web scraping, and database management. I particularly enjoyed learning how to collect and analyze data from the web, which deepened my understanding of how programming can solve real-world problems.

    Another significant certification I obtained is the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity. This beginner-friendly program helped me develop a solid understanding of web development, covering key technologies such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also focused on building web applications, which gave me practical skills in creating fully functional websites. These courses have significantly enhanced my programming and development abilities, and I am excited to apply these skills to future projects.</p>

    <h2>Additional Knowledge and Specializations</h2>
    <p class="no-red-line"> Beyond traditional programming, I have developed expertise in emerging fields like Data Science and Cybersecurity. My knowledge in Data Science has been refined through various projects involving statistical analysis, data visualization, and data manipulation. I have a strong grasp of tools like Python's Pandas library, which allows me to work with large datasets and extract meaningful insights. This skill set is vital for analyzing big data and making data-driven decisions in any IT-related field.

      In addition to Data Science, I have delved into Cybersecurity, a field that is becoming increasingly important as technology continues to advance. I have learned the fundamentals of ethical hacking, risk assessment, and data protection, which are essential skills for safeguarding information systems. As cyber threats continue to evolve, I am committed to staying up-to-date with best practices and technologies in cybersecurity to ensure secure systems and data integrity.</p>


      <h2>Hobbies and Personal Projects</h2>
      <p class="large-text">When I'm not coding or learning, I enjoy spending time with my hobbies, especially photography. Capturing moments in nature and urban environments has taught me to appreciate the details of the world around me. I enjoy experimenting with different editing techniques to enhance my photos and create visually appealing images. My photography has become a creative outlet, and I have built a Photography Portfolio to showcase my work.

        Additionally, I have a passion for developing Programming Projects. I frequently work on small web applications, games, and tools that help me improve my coding skills. Whether it's building a simple to-do list application or a more complex game, I focus on writing clean code and ensuring a positive user experience. You can explore some of these projects on my GitHub Portfolio, where I share my latest work and contributions to open-source projects. These personal projects allow me to experiment with new technologies and continuously evolve as a developer.</p>
