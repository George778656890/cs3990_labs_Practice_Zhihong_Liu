  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p class="small-text">  In my previous roles, I have gained valuable work experience in software development, web design, and technical support. During my internship at Tech Innovators, I collaborated with a team of developers to design and implement a web application that helped clients streamline their business operations. I was responsible for front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring the user interface was intuitive and responsive. This experience strengthened my coding skills and gave me hands-on knowledge of the software development lifecycle.

    Furthermore, I worked as a part-time technical support assistant at XYZ Corp, where I provided assistance to customers experiencing technical issues with their software products. This role improved my problem-solving skills and ability to troubleshoot under pressure, ensuring customers received timely and effective solutions.</p>
    
  <h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
   <p class="no-red-line"> Throughout my academic journey and personal projects, I have worked on a variety of initiatives that showcase my skills and creativity. One notable project was the development of an interactive website for a local charity, where I designed and implemented features like donation forms, event calendars, and volunteer sign-ups. This project not only improved my coding abilities but also deepened my understanding of working with real-world clients and meeting their specific needs.

  Another significant achievement was participating in the annual university hackathon, where my team and I developed a mobile app that helps users track their daily water intake. We won second place in the competition, which was a great accomplishment that showcased our teamwork, innovation, and problem-solving skills.  </p>

  <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
  <p class="large-text">Outside of my professional and academic life, I am passionate about staying active and exploring new hobbies. I enjoy hiking in nature, particularly around Vancouver's beautiful trails, where I can unwind and appreciate the outdoors. I also have an interest in photography, and I often experiment with landscape and portrait photography. Capturing moments through the lens allows me to express my creativity and attention to detail.

    In addition, I have a deep interest in technology and enjoy experimenting with new tools and programming languages. In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects and participate in online coding challenges, which help me stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and sharpen my skills. </p>
